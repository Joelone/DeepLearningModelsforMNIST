# DeepLearningModelsforMNIST
Using several neural network models to identify MNIST dataset. Including:
- Linear model
- Multi-layer deep neural network, fully connected
- Convolutional neural network
- Recurrent neural network, LSTM cell, single layer
- Recurrent neural network, LSTM cell, multi-layer with dropouts
- Bidirectional recurrent neural network, LSTM cell, it works pretty well.
- Generative adversarial network

Using variable name to wrap those variables.
